# This is todo app project

Build with Vite, React, Typescript, SCSS, UUID
As application is very simple I didn't use any state library like zustand / redux. Kept it simple as possible without overengineering.

# Instalataion

npm run dev

# Functionalities

Changing filters
Persistance with localStorage(tasks, activeFilter)

# Future steps

Moving some part of logic to the server side, as saving tasks in the cookies for example and serve it from server for better ux. Moving active filter to URL. API connection.

# Estimation
